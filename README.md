SAPUI5 shenanigans - Mandelbrot fractal in sap.m.Table
Learning by doing.
This is not right.
But it's fun.

### Why?
To get a deeper understanding of how the SAPUI5 works and the different ways of accomplishing things, I decided to go through the SAPUI5 Walkthrough again and dig deeper beyond what was explained. I also wanted some kind of resource to go back to in order to see how I did things in different ways.

One way of learning is to push things, break things, and put them together again, and in some ways I kind of did that here.

And since I experienced a new-found appreciation for fractals recently, why should I not render a Mandelbrot set in a SAPUI5 sap.m.Table?
(I don't think the Fiori design guidelines strictly forbids it, but if this is a business requirement, maybe SAPUI5 is not the best choice for it)
